Each With Progress Version 0.1
--------------------------------
Version .1 Update
--------------------------------
Now returns the enumerable you're looping over to be more in line with the other each methods.

--------------------------------
Works exactly the same as Enumerable#each but prints a progress bar to the console on each iteration

Example:

my_huge_array.each_with_progress do |i|
  puts "doing some awesome thing to this array element"
end
